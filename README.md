## Research on music streaming & data analytics <br>
Before you dive into the actual process of collection and analysis of the data, your first component is about researching and understanding the 2 most important parts <br>

**(i)  Music Streaming services** <br>
**(ii) Data Analytics process<br>**

## Study streaming services
Netflix is famous for its recommendation system which allows users to decide what movie or tv show to stream next, based on their viewing history. <br>

But the Netflix recommendation system is not solely based on viewing history. It is a lot more complicated. The company collects a lot of user data to not only recommend existing movies to their users, but also to pick new media for their streaming service.<br>

Similarly, a lot of different kinds of streaming services analyse user data. <br>

Try and answer the following questions for any 2 streaming services (1 video streaming service and 1 music streaming service) -<br> 

**1. What user data do they collect?**
**2. Why do they need this user data?**
**3. How do they end up using this data to create a better service?**

# Use-of-Data-Analysis-to-Study-Music-Streaming-Pattern<br>

# *PART ONE*

## Research on music streaming & data analytics <br>
*Before I dive into the actual process of collecting and analyzing the data, my first step is to research and understand the two most important components.* <br>

**(i)  Music Streaming services** <br>
**(ii) Data Analytics process<br>**

## Study streaming services
Netflix is famous for its recommendation system which allows users to decide what movie or tv show to stream next, based on their viewing history. <br>

But the Netflix recommendation system is not solely based on viewing history. It is a lot more complicated. The company collects a lot of user data to not only recommend existing movies to their users, but also to pick new media for their streaming service.<br>

Similarly, a lot of different kinds of streaming services analyse user data. <br>

I will try to answer the following questions for two streaming services: one video streaming service and one music streaming service. -<br> 

**1. What user data do they collect?** <br>
**2. Why do they need this user data?** <br>
**3. How do they end up using this data to create a better service?** <br>

## Report on data analytics procedure <br>
*After understanding why services need user data, it is important to understand how this data is analysed.* <br>
1. Definition of Data Analytics <br>
2. Process of Data Analysis <br>
3. Tools & Techniques used to analyse Data <br>
4. Barriers to Effective Analysis <br>

# *PART TWO*
## Data mining and wrangling for music streaming. <br>
*In the next two components, I will analyze the music streaming patterns of five individuals and provide personalized music recommendations based on my analysis of their listening preferences.* <br>

## Identify the Data Requirements <br>
I will create a free Spotify account and select five individuals with diverse music tastes. Based on their preferences, I will create playlists featuring the 10 most frequently played songs for each individual. <br>
For reference, some of the most popular music genres include Pop, Rock, Indie, Metal, Country, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Classical, Reggae, Soul, and Electronic.*<br>
Using Spotify's "Sort Your Music" feature (link provided below), I will analyze the playlists. This feature will display the values for various music attributes for each song in the playlists.<br>

## Identify the variables necessary for data analysis. <br>
I will outline the key variables to focus on for understanding the music streaming patterns of the five individuals and analyze their significance. To achieve this, I will conduct individual research on each variable and explore its effect on a song's pattern. <br>
Examples of these variables include BPM (Beats Per Minute), Energy, Danceability, and others. <br>

## Tabulate the data <br>
The values for the various attributes will serve as the foundation for my raw data. <br>
I will collect the necessary data and organize it into a well-structured table using Google Sheets or MS Excel.<br>
Afterward, I will cross-check the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. By examining the table, I will understand the significance of the data and determine how it can be utilized effectively for the analysis. <br>

# *PART THREE*
## Understanding music streaming pattern through visual representation of data. <br>
*Now that I have collected and tabulated the data, the next step is to visually represent and analyze it for interpretation.* <br>
*I will analyze the data to identify patterns in each individual's music preferences. Based on this analysis, I will recommend a playlist of songs tailored to their unique tastes.* <br>

### *In this data analysis project, I used Tableau to analyze the data and presented my findings in a dashboard.*
